# Multi-agent MDPs 

This code provides an implementation of fully observable Markov Decision Problems (MDPs), and allows multiple agents to interact with them, and to interact with one another.

## Installation

To install from GitHub, use `pip install git+https://github.com/tobywise/multi_agent_mdp.git`. 

## Compatibility

This code has been tested with Python 3.7 and 3.8. It may work with earlier versions, but currently does not work with 3.9 due to its reliance on `Numba`, which is not compatible with 3.9 currently.

## Examples

Examples are provided in the `notebooks` directory.
